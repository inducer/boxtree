Installation
============

This command should install the latest release of :mod:`boxtree` directly from PyPI::

    pip install boxtree

You may need to run this with :command:`sudo` if you are not in a virtual environment
(not recommended). If you don't already have `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`__,
run this beforehand::

    python -m ensurepip

For a more manual installation, download the source, unpack it, and run::

    pip install .

This should also install all the required dependencies. The main one is PyOpenCL,
which has extensive installation instruction on the
`PyOpenCL Wiki <http://wiki.tiker.net/PyOpenCL/Installation>`__.

For development, you may want to install in `editable mode
<https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html>`__::

    pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .[test]
